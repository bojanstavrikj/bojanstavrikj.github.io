        <h1>About</h1>
        <div class="par">
          <p>Hi my name is Bojan, I am a Macedonian citizen with a mix of balkan and international culture. Having lived across 4 different countries in Europe and met people from numerous nations, I have managed to absorb the best of each. I grew up in Macedonia until the age of 12. I then moved to Budapest, Hungary  where spent the next 8 years. I finished my High School education there and went off to Rotterdam to do my bachelor degree in Economics at Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR). While writing my thesis I moved back to Budapest and started working for Citibank as Junior Product Controll Analyist.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="par">
          <p>Right now, I am living in Lisbon, where I am doing my Master degree at NOVA IMS in the field of Data Science and Advanced Analytics with a major in Business Analytics. We are being trained to become professional data scientists by working on challenging projects using real data. I have experience with supervised/unsupervised machine learning models including forecasting, classification, prediction and segmentation. I am currently searching for job opportunities related to Data Science, available to start any time from 1<sup>st</sup> of July onwards.</p>

            <h2>Developing New Control Tool - Citibank</h2>
            <p>I developed a new controlling tool for the team in excel. It spread over more than 10 interconnected sheets controlling and reconciling data from 3 different systems on several levels of grain. The challenge was to have all the data in one place while making it run fast without having to go through many formulas to obtain the final result. Data would be inputted over several sheets, from 3 different sources; manual ledger adjustments would be added to the file depending on where the system is breaking and needs to be adjusted. All of this would then be summarized as a simulation of what the final numbers would be after all necessary adjustments are uploaded in the system. This summary was shown on day-to-date, month-to-date and year-to-date basis, including a difference calculation to the initial risk system. After all of this was done, a final system number would be inputed for a final check. Once the trading desk approves and agrees with the final reported numbers, a macro was created in order to distribute the numbers to a list of managers within the company.</p>

            <h2>Demand Forecasting - NOVA IMS</h2>
            <p>This project was developed in a team of 4. The data used is real and obtained from a transportation company based in Algarve, Portugal whose name cannot be disclosed. The company had trouble in determining the right number of drivers to hire for different periods of the year. That is where my colleagues and I came in. We built a predictive model using Machine Learning techniques for estimating expected number of services. The challenges faced in this project were data quality and aggregation. On top of that the client asked for 4 week batch predictions 8 weeks in advance, due to long hiring processes. The client asked for a maximum mean absolute error of 10% in the model. We managed to achieve a 5% error on average.</p>

            <h2>Booking Cancellation Prediction - NOVA IMS</h2>
            <p>This project was developed in a team of 4. The data used is real and obtained from a hotel based in Lisboa, Portugal. The issue the hotel had was a staggering 40% booking cancellation rate. This is largely contributed to by Online Travel Agencies (OTA's) such as booking.com and airbnb. Our team explored and cleaned the data before focusing on the main problem. We managed to build a predictive model with 81% accuracy that could be deployed immediately. Lastly, we advised management on deployment, maintenance and several strategies on how to react to certain predictions.</p>

            <h2>Customer Segmentation - NOVA IMS</h2>
            <p>This project was developed in a team of 4. The data used is real and obtained from a hotel based in Lisboa, Portugal. At the time the hotel had implemented a customer segmentation which was based solely on the booking platform the customer used last. Our team obtained data on a large number of clients of this hotel and managed to perform in-depth analysis on the types of customers that book stays at the hotel in question. The end product resulted in 4 segments for the specific static dataset. Lastly our team gave detailed description of each cluster and suggestions on deployment, maintenance as well as marketing strategies for each profile of customers.</p>
